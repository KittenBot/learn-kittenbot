## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Q1: Why can't I find the serial port after switching to microPython mode on Meowbit?
> This issue usually occurs if you're using a stripped-down version of your operating system lacking essential system files. Therefore, some device drivers may not install automatically. Here are two possible solutions:
> 
> **Method 1: Simple Manual Installation**
> 1. Locate the driver installation file in the PYBFLASH drive.
