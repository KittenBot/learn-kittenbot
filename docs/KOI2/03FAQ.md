## FAQ





## Q1: Can the KOI2 camera rotate?
> Yes, the KOI camera can rotate 180°.





## Q2: What is the drive voltage of KOI2?
> The drive voltage requires 5V, so it cannot be driven directly by microbit. It can be driven by the 5V power pin of the robotbit extension board.





## Q3: How many categories does the KOI2 machine learning model support?
> KOI2 is memory optimized and can support more than 20 categories. (KOI1 can only support 40 photos, which is approximately 10 categories.)





## Q4：Does KOI2 support text-to-speech？
> KOI2 cannot synthesize speech. However, it can play single channel WAV files.





## Q5: Where can I program KOI2 as the master controller?
> KOI uses microPython and can be programmed on KittenCode software for KittenBot. For beginners, it is recommended to use KOI2 as a module and program it in Kittenblock.





## Q6: KOI2 gets hot during use? Is this normal?
> KOI2 uses the K210 AI chip, which generates heat due to high-speed operation. This is normal.





## Q7: Can KOI2 implement text recognition?
> Implement the recognition of single digits 0~9 and separate letters A~F respectively.





## Q8: Can KOI2 recognize license plates?
> No.





## Q9: Does KOI2 have a built-in battery?
> It does not contain a battery and can only be powered via the serial interface or the USB interface.





## Q10: The screen of KOI2 looks bright in the center and dim around the edges. What is the problem?
> This phenomenon is normal because it is a single-chip solution, and the camera uses a 0v2640 camera, which cannot be compared with a general mobile phone camera or computer camera.





## Q11: How far can the KOI2 camera see at its maximum distance?
> The distance varies depending on the AI function. For example, facial recognition can reach a distance of 1.5 meters. QR code scanning can reach a distance of about 20 centimeters.





## Q13: Does KOI2 adjust the focal length of the camera?
> The object distance of the KOI camera has been adjusted at the factory and has been coated with a black gel, so it cannot be rotated for adjustment.





## Q14: KOI2 Koi doesn't recognize the inserted memory card

> KOI (K210 chip) is quite picky with memory cards. It is recommended to use original SanDisk or Kingston memory cards with a capacity of 16 GB or 8 GB





## Q15: What is the Reset button on KOI2 for?
> Press and hold the Reset button for 2 seconds and KOI will restart.
