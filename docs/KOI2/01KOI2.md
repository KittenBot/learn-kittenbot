## Product Details
---
KOI2 is an AI camera module based on the K210 chip from KittenBot Technology, which aims to combine advanced AI technology and high-performance embedded systems to provide strong support for visual recognition and intelligent AI applications.
It comes with hardware such as a screen, camera, speaker, microphone, and buttons, which can fully unleash the capabilities of AI applications.
It has a front and rear flip camera, a plastic case with Lego structural holes, providing a richer and more convenient building form, meeting the classroom and project needs of educational scenarios.
We provide friendly Kittenblock plug-ins and Makecode plug-ins, which combine KOI2 with the main control board to use graphical programming to explore the new world of AI.

## Features

## KOI2 vs. KOI Functionality Comparison
Since its launch, KittenBot's KOI artificial intelligence module has been widely loved by students and teachers for its powerful functionality and educational design. In 2024, KittenBot upgraded the KOI firmware and optimized its hardware, renaming it KOI2.
To meet the needs of certain competitions and creative projects, the new firmware adds mask recognition, letter recognition, number recognition, traffic sign recognition, general recognition of 20 objects, and self-training models. (Due to limited internal space, functions with poor performance have been removed.)
KOI's overall frame rate has been increased, and its overall framework has been optimized, with more reasonable communication and memory allocation.
