Happy Birthday: c4:4 c4:4 d4:4 c4:4 f4:4 e4:8 r:4 c4:4 c4:4 d4:4 c4:4 g4:4 f4:8 r:4 c4:4 c4:4 c5:4 a4:4 f4:4 e4:4 d4:8 r:4 bb4:4 bb4:4 a4:4 f4:4 g4:4 f4:8

## Play preset music
ðŸ“‘ï¼šIf you find it troublesome, you can also use the preset music building block directly. Choose some appropriate sounds to create an atmosphere.<br />It is recommended that you enter the online mode and click Run directly during the debugging phase, because the first parameter type can only be a string, so it is troublesome to listen to all preset audios by writing programs<br />![image-20240322122824184](https://learn.kittenbot.cn/2024md_pic/image-20240322122824184.png)
