## Gesture Detection
ðŸ“‘: Gestures are encapsulated based on three-axis accelerometers, and generally speaking this building block is enough. <br />
For other high-level usage, use the acceleration value building block directly. <br />

##  Internal Temperature
ðŸ“‘: This block is used to read the device cpu temperature, which may be used by users in advanced applications. Used to confirm the status of the motherboard. If measuring the ambient temperature, it is recommended to use the Sugar Temperature and Humidity Module<br />![image-20240322121920853](https://learn.kittenbot.cn/2024md_pic/image-20240322121920853.png)
