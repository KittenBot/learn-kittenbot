##  Introduction

NanoScript is a board developed by KittenBot based on the MSR RP2040 Brain. It is designed specifically for the Microsoft DeviceScript platform. The board adheres to the EC30 standard of Jacdac in terms of overall dimensions and features a standard Jacdac Edge Connector, which allows for seamless connection with various Jacdac electronic modules.

 The board is designed with gold-plated through-holes, resembling postage stamps, enabling developers to easily solder it as a module onto their own development boards.
