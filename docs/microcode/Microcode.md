## What is MicroCode?

![image-20240620150801501](Microcode.assets/image-20240620150801501.png)

MicroCode is a graphical programming platform created by Microsoft specifically for young children. It enables programming on the Microbit V2 without the need for a computer or tablet. By inserting the Microbit into a dedicated expansion board with a color screen, children can complete programming creations by writing icon-based logic directly on the board. MicroCode offers a visual programming model based on Kodu, suitable for children aged 6-9. This document will introduce the features, basic usage, precautions, and a quick start guide for MicroCode.

## Features

MicroCode is a visual programming tool for Microbit V2, designed to provide a simple programming experience for children. Its main features include:

- **Anywhere, Anytime**: Enables programming anytime and anywhere, accompanied by a familiar game controller to attract children.
- **Child-Friendly**: Icon-based, structured code editor and programming language, easy for children to use.
- **Sample Programs**: Provides numerous sample programs to help users get started quickly.
- **Extended Functions**: Use Jacdac accessories (such as LEDs, servo motors, etc.) for expansion and programming.
- **Robot Control**: Use MicroCode to program and control small robots for line following and other functions.
- **Multilingual Support**: An international programming platform supporting over 20 languages.

## Required Hardware

The hardware needed for using MicroCode graphical programming:

### Basic Essentials:

1. [Microbit V2 (V1.5 is not supported)](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=629040300061&skuId=4858762989208&spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-25280158849.9.3f555d5fT0wMNd)

2. [Newbit Arcade Shield](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=647757869106&skuId=5609200898405&spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-25280158849.11.3f555d5fT0wMNd)

![image-20240603155711761](Microcode.assets/image-20240603155711761.png)

### Optional Extensions:

1. Jacdac KitA Electronic Kit
2. MicroCode Programming Car

## Quick Start

For the first use, you need to download the MicroCode firmware for Microbit V2. Subsequent uses do not require a download.

1. Open the website [microcode (microsoft.github.io)](https://microsoft.github.io/microcode/)

![image-20240531111449261](Microcode.assets/image-20240531111449261.png)

2. Follow the instructions in the image to download the MicroCode firmware and save it to your computer.

![image-20240531111516350](Microcode.assets/image-20240531111516350.png)

3. Connect the Microbit V2 to your computer using a MicroUSB cable, and drag (or copy) the downloaded firmware to the Microbit V2's USB drive.

![image-20240531111715565](Microcode.assets/image-20240531111715565.png)

4. After the download is complete, insert the Microbit V2 into the Newbit Arcade Shield and disconnect the USB data cable. The Newbit Arcade Shield offers a lithium battery accessory, and it is recommended to purchase the package with the lithium battery accessory.

![image-20240531112040006](Microcode.assets/image-20240531112040006.png)

5. Turn on the power switch, and you will see MicroCode appear on the screen (for subsequent uses, simply turn on the power).

## Basic Operations

Use the Newbit Arcade Shieldâ€™s four directional buttons to move the cursor.
- **A Button (Blue Button)**: Confirm
- **B Button (Red Button)**: Return

### Opening Examples

For the first use, select "Examples" (as shown in the image below) to quickly experience the charm of MicroCode.

![image-20240603160322515](Microcode.assets/image-20240603160322515.png)

In the programming icons, Button A and Button B refer to the Microbit's Button A and Button B. Our expansion board acts like a "mini-computer," programming the Microbit through the "mini-computer." When we press Microbit's Button A and Button B, the matrix and buzzer will respond accordingly.

### Creating a Program

Create a blank program.

![image-20240603160647184](Microcode.assets/image-20240603160647184.png)

### Editing the Last Program

Selecting edit will open the last program by default. Even if the device is turned off, it will open the program from before it was turned off.

![image-20240603160934130](Microcode.assets/image-20240603160934130.png)

### Saving a Program

MicroCode supports storing up to three programs. Each time you save, you will choose a storage location; there are three locations in total. If there is an existing program, it will be overwritten.

## Programming Syntax

MicroCode's programming syntax is straightforward, with only one rule: "When... Do...". For example, when Microbit Button A is pressed, the matrix lights up with a smiley face. Other icons can be gradually understood through practice.

## Hardware Expansion

In addition to programming for Microbit V2, MicroCode also supports sensor programming for external sensors, suitable for second-stage advanced learning with MicroCode.

Currently, it supports the Jacdac KitA electronic kit, which is suitable for small projects for young children. KitA includes button modules, rotary encoders, light-sensitive modules, magnetic sensors, light ring modules, and sliding potentiometers.

### Connecting and Using Jacdac Modules

Use the dedicated Jacdac connection cables for wiring, which can be inserted either way, offering a great experience. For example, using the connection cable to connect the RGB light ring, you will see an LED icon in the programming interface indicating that this sensor is available.
